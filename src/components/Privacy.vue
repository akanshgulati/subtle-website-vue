    <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
    <p>
      Subtletab, Inc (collectively “Subtletab”, "we", "us", and "ours") is
      committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”)
      describes how we processes Personal Data in its capacity as a controller
      (i.e. Subtletab decides what Personal Data is collected and what it is
      used for) or processor (i.e. Subtletab only processes the data as per the
      controller's instructions), as the case may be. This policy is applicable
      to Subtletab public website,
      <a href="https://subtletab.com" title="subtletab">subtletab.com</a> and
      Subtletab products' website and products itself (web platform, browser
      extensions and mobile applications) such as
      <a href="https://coronatrends.live" title="coronatrends"
        >coronatrends.live</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://akansh.com" title="akansh">https://akansh.com</a>
      website. In following notice, we will be referring to extensions or
      add-ons or utilities which are only related to Chrome and Firefox
      browsers.
    </p>
    <h3>Whom does this notice applies to?</h3>
    <p>
      This Notice applies to (i) entities or individuals, excluding End-Users
      and Users, who have subscribed to our Service(s) and have agreed to the
      permissions (hereinafter referred to as the “Customer”) and (ii)
      individuals (“Individuals”) from whom Subtletab collects data as a
      controller.
    </p>
    <h3>What Personal Information is collected and why?</h3>
    When you visit Subtletab or its products' website, we may collect your
    anonymous aggregated event related data (collectively called as "Collected
    Data") using standard third party analytics service (Google Analytics) to
    better understand and improve content and experience. No personal
    information related to user is collected as a controller. For the purposes
    of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Subtletab shall be the
    controller for the Collected Data – this means that Subtletab decides what
    Collected Data is processed and why.
    <strong
      >Any information isn’t and has never been sold to third parties.</strong
    >

    <h4>Data accessible through WebExtensions API</h4>
    WebExtension APIs used within Chrome Extensions and Firefox Add-ons have
    fine-grained permission levels that are enforced by the Web Browser,
    restricting information that our extension has access to within your
    Browser. The Subtletab and its other extensions can only access specific
    information that you have explicitly granted permission for. We can not and
    do not track your browsing history. We make sure to ask for optional
    permissions specific to feature within extensions. When you requests an
    optional permission, your Web Browser will make it show a clear dialog box
    specifying what permission(s) are being requested. The feature will be
    accessible only once you choose to allow the requested permission(s). Here
    are the list of permissions as per extensions we are providing:
